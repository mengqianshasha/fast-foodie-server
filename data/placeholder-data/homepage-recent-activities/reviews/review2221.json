Every plate is three dollars. If there's something you want but it's not available on the belt, you can request it via the screen at your table and it will come directly to you. Also, there is a robot that comes to drop off wasabi and ginger. Fuun. Even with all the technology available, servers were still present and made sure to check on us often through the meal.",
