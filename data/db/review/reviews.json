I got the regular hamburger and wow… there are no words. A classic burger done right. Crisp bun, juicy patty, stuffed with all the essentials (ketchup, shredded lettuce, tomato, and pickles). There’s about a million options available between the menu board and wall full of specials, so it can get a little overwhelming, but you really can’t go wrong. Not much else to say besides go see for yourself! You won’t be disappointed."
